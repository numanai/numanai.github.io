I am a PhD student at the [BioMedIA lab](https://mbzuai-biomedia.com/biomedia/) at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)] (https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) advised by Professor [Mohammad Yaqub](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/mohammad-yaqub/). I am currently interested in developing  AI-based solutions for health-related problems. I am interested in exploring self-supervised learning and multimodal learning to solve disease diagnosis and prognosis problems. 

Prior to MBZUAI, I obtained a masterâ€™s degree in Microsystems Engineering from [Masdar Institute of Science and Technology (now Khalifa University)](https://www.ku.ac.ae/). I was fortunate to work there with [Dr. Jaime Viegas]([https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/jerald-yoo/](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/jaime-viegas) to model and characterize Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs), a type of MEMS device that can generate and detect ultrasound waves.

I also worked previously at [Etihad Airways] (https://www.etihad.com/en-ae/?CID=PPC-UAE-GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInZOXobOP_QIVYRoGAB29igBvEAAYASAAEgK9qvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) as a Senior Analytics Specialist to build solutions for passenger bookings forecasting, predicting ancillary revenue, and Churn predictions.
