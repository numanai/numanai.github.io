As a dedicated researcher passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to healthcare, I specialize in AI for Healthcare, Machine Learning, Data Science, and MEMS Transducers. I am pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy in Machine Learning at the prestigious [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), where I am a Ph.D. student at the [BioMedIA lab](https://mbzuai-biomedia.com/biomedia/), as advised by Professor [Mohammad Yaqub](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/mohammad-yaqub/). My research focuses on Deep Learning for Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis, with a particular interest in exploring self-supervised learning and multimodal learning to solve disease diagnosis and prognosis problems.

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained a Master's in Microsystems Engineering from [Masdar Institute of Science and Technology (now Khalifa University)](https://www.ku.ac.ae/). During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Jaime Viegas](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/jaime-viegas) to model and characterize Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs), a type of MEMS device that can generate and detect ultrasound waves.

In addition to my academic achievements, I also have practical experience in the industry. I worked as a Senior Analytics Specialist at [Etihad Airways](https://www.etihad.com), developing solutions for forecasting passenger bookings, predicting ancillary revenue, and Churn predictions using classical methods, 1D-CNN, and LSTM models. I also designed a mobile app for internal use that utilized web scraping routines for aviation news collection. I consistently delivered valuable insights to the business through data visualization and summarization of results.

I am a dedicated and enthusiastic researcher, constantly seeking ways to leverage my AI, machine learning, and data science expertise to make a meaningful impact in healthcare. I am always open to collaborations and opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge research projects.
